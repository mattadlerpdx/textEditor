# textEditor
//This program simulates a text editor. The bst holds keywords that will be used to change the text sstored in an array of linked lists, found in the class.h. 
//Tree.cpp: This part of the program manages the implementation of the binary search tree. Implementation of the 2-3 tree is commented out since seg faults and memory leaks affected the program. The bst holds 3 key words: BROWN, FoX, and Lazy. There is a function that stores the contents of the bst into an array of pointers. From the contents of that array, a function from arr.cpp will take that data and replace the matching words with the keywords from the bst. 
//The insert algorithm for the 2-3 tree is reliant upon how the node is structured. Each node has a right, middle and left pointer. Each node's private data members are large--the largest data item in the node, small--the smallest data item in the node, counter--which is our flag to see if there are two nodes(this will cause a split), and toAdd--the data item between small and large which will be pushed up to the node that has room. 
//The split will use head recursion, passing counter, toAdd, small, and large by reference. Inserting on the way down happens if there is room. Splitting and inserting will occur on the way back, changing the private data member accordingly and saving them since these arguments will be passed by reference.
